# WebPack multiple css output with extract-text-webpack-plugin


<br /><br />
## Getting Started
### Install pre-requisites
- Node.js and NPM: [Download and install](https://nodejs.org/). *I have version 6.6.0 of Node and 3.10.6 of NPM on Windows PC*
- Git: [Download and install](https://git-scm.com/). *I have version 2.7.4 installed on Windows PC*

### Clone Repo
1. Get the url of your forked project.
    - Go to https://github.com/username/webpack-multiple-css-output
2. Click on **"Clone or download"** and Copy to clipboard the url ending on .git.
3. Open your command line and go to your directoy  
*You don't need to create a specific folder for the project, it will be created by git*
4. Clone your forked repo on your machine:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/username/webpack-multiple-css-output
```  
*Note: That will create a new folder called webpack-multiple-css-output with all the files in.*

### Install Project dependencies
As we have yarn, instead of using npm i to install all our dependencies in our node_modules folder, we will use just yarn.
*Note: you need to be sure your are inside the project folder because yarn will look for package.json file.*

```
$ cd webpack-multiple-css-output
$ npm i
```

### Build
```
$ npm run build
```

### Done!
